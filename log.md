# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sept 2nd 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Finally fixed bug in my National Parks API app. Edited all names in js code per mentor advice. 

**Thoughts:** The code still feels hacky, but I am glad that it is working now. Feeling more confident using multiple APIs together.
